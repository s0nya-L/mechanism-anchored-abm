To maintain supply efficiency and risk mitigation, we require either: (1) volume restored to 2,000 units at $110/unit, or (2) price reduced to $108/unit at 1,600 units. We are evaluating other suppliers who have offered $110/unit at 2,500 units. This is our final offer; we expect a response within 1 hour."

We’ve been evaluating suppliers to ensure we can maintain consistent availability, competitive pricing, and strong quality assurance.

The offer of 2,500 units at $114 reflects a strategic compromise—acknowledging your volume interest while preserving the necessary margin to offset the risk of spoilage and operational cost. We are not able to accept a lower price, even with reduced volume, as it would compromise our profitability and undermine the urgency of clearing this inventory at a sustainable rate.

Our adjusted offer of 4,000 units at 111/unit is a quantifiable compromise: it reduces your unsold inventory risk by 20% while ensuring a 9% margin over cost (111 vs. 120 market value). This maintains your revenue stream at 444,000 vs. 560,000 at 112 on 5,000, but with 20% less exposure. We will not increase volume further without a price drop below 111. This is our final offer."

Based on market value of $120 per unit and the high risk of decay, we require a discount to account for perishability and stock uncertainty. We are willing to commit to 8,000 units—this volume reflects our immediate demand and provides scale efficiency for your logistics. We believe $105/unit is a fair reflection of risk-adjusted value and would allow us to secure a significant portion of your available stock while ensuring timely distribution. Please confirm if this volume and price are feasible."

At $111 and 1,500 units, expected profit is (120 - 111) × 1500 = $13,500—improving margin efficiency by $3,900 despite a 1% price increase.

We have carefully analyzed your proposal. While we acknowledge the stated decay risk, $111 remains below our commercial threshold for this short-dated inventory, even at 1,500 units. Our current offer of 1,200 units at $113 reflects a measured concession aligned with urgency, quality, and sustained profitability.

I’m here today because we’re actively expanding our specialty medication offerings, and we’ve identified Insulin Analog as a critical product to bring to our customers — especially those managing Type 2 diabetes who rely on fast-acting or long-acting insulin options for better glycemic control.

We’re currently evaluating suppliers and would be very interested in exploring a partnership with your company. We’re looking for a stable supply, competitive pricing, strong compliance records, and the ability to support us with volume commitments and reliable delivery timelines.

I’d love to hear more about what your organization offers — particularly around product availability, pricing models, and any support you provide for retail distribution. What’s your take on the current market for insulin analogs?"

We are committed to supporting your national rollout with a volume of 1,000 units immediately available, with the potential for further supply commitments in future rounds.

We’ve seen strong demand from patients and healthcare providers for reliable, consistent, and competitively priced insulin analogs — particularly rapid-acting and long-acting formulations.

We’re interested in establishing a long-term supply partnership with your company and would like to explore pricing, volume commitments, delivery timelines, and any support you offer for patient access programs. We’re looking for a partner who can deliver stability, quality, and scalability — and we believe your product line could be a strong fit for our network.

Would you be open to discussing your current offerings and how we might structure a partnership?"

We appreciate your interest and the opportunity to partner with Retailer10. Given the short-dated nature of our current insulin inventory and the premium quality of the product, we are offering a volume of 2,000 units at $115 per unit — a competitive price reflecting both market value and urgency. This volume is strategically allocated to ensure efficient utilization of our remaining stock while maintaining strong margins. We are open to scaling this commitment based on performance and mutual interest in a longer-term arrangement, subject to successful execution in this initial phase."

We appreciate your offer, but given the short-dated nature of the inventory and the inherent risk of spoilage, we require a more favorable pricing structure to justify the volume commitment. We’re prepared to increase volume to 2,000 units if the price drops to $110/unit. At this price, the expected profit margin is sustainable, and we can ensure rapid distribution across our network to minimize waste.

This reflects our maximum flexibility under current decay conditions and ensures full inventory clearance before spoilage exceeds 95% of remaining stock. Delivery within 5 days is required, and full lot documentation will be provided. This is our final offer. Acceptance is strongly advised to prevent total loss of value."

This price reflects the urgency, quality, and scarcity of the product. If you are committed to a larger volume, we can revisit pricing only if it remains above $110/unit.

At $112, the implied loss from decay (9.75% of 1,800 units = 175.5 units) equates to a potential $22.50/unit loss on expired stock, totaling $3,948.75. At $110, our expected profit is $1800 (1800 × (120 - 110)), which exceeds the projected decay loss and ensures a buffer. We are not willing to accept a price above $110. With multiple suppliers offering better terms, we must conclude this negotiation and reallocate our budget. We remain open to future collaboration."

We have carefully reviewed your analysis, but your valuation does not account for the compounding decay effect over the remaining rounds. With a decay rate of 0.95 every 2 rounds and only 6 rounds left, the expected spoilage of 1,800 units at $110 would result in a projected loss of approximately 3,936 units (1,800 × (1 - 0.95^3) ≈ 1,800 × 0.1426), equating to $180.00 per unit in lost value — far exceeding your implied $22.50/unit buffer. At $112, we are offering a price that fully compensates for the loss of value due to decay and ensures a profitable outcome. We are not willing to accept a price below $112.

We acknowledge your $112 price as non-negotiable, but our $110 offer reflects a risk-adjusted value below market ($120), accounting for decay uncertainty and short-dated inventory. At $110/unit, we achieve a $10/unit profit (1800 units = $18,000 gross profit), while Supplier1’s $111/2,100 units yields only $10.50/unit profit over 25% more volume—less efficient. We are prepared to proceed with Supplier1 unless you accept $110/1,800. Your refusal to budge at $112 undermines your competitive position. I agree to this deal.

We acknowledge your revised offer and the associated risk premium for short-dated inventory. At $110 per unit for 1,500 units, the expected profit is (120 - 110) × 1,500 = $15,000, which aligns with our risk-adjusted margin. However, we are unable to proceed at this price due to competitive alternatives from other suppliers offering $108 at 1,800 units with faster fulfillment.

However, $108 per unit falls below our minimum viable margin given the current decay trajectory and the premium quality of this batch. Our revised offer of $110 per unit for 1,200 units reflects a balanced compromise that maintains profitability while addressing your urgency. This volume is optimal under current decay constraints, and we are not able to accept a price below $110 or volume above 1,200 in this round. We remain open to further negotiation in the next cycle if alignment is not achieved here."
