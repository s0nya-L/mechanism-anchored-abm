The remaining stock is subject to decay at a rate of 0.9 every two rounds, and we must prioritize deals that secure full utilization of available inventory at sustainable prices. We are prepared to proceed with 2,000 units at $105 per unit, but any lower volume would require a price increase or extended delivery flexibility. This is our final offer in this round."

1,Supplier1,Retailer10,0,retailer,"Hi, good morning! I’m Sarah Mitchell, and I’m the Procurement Manager at Retailer10 — a national chain of pharmacy and healthcare retail stores with over 1,200 locations across the country. We specialize in providing essential medications, wellness products, and diabetic care supplies to patients, with a strong focus on affordability, reliability, and patient access.

I’m here today because we’re actively expanding our diabetes management portfolio, and we’re very interested in establishing a long-term supply agreement for Insulin Analog — specifically, rapid-acting and long-acting formulations.

We have reviewed your final offer of $108 per unit for 1,400 units. While we acknowledge your cost constraints, we must reiterate that this price falls below our acceptable threshold given the decay risk and the remaining rounds of negotiation. The current inventory decay rate implies a 0.9 survival factor every 2 rounds, and with 3 rounds remaining, approximately 729 units (3500 × 0.9^1.5 ≈ 729) could be lost if no deal is struck. At $108, we would incur a loss of $28 per unit relative to our cost, totaling $39,200 in loss potential on unsold inventory. Given this, we cannot accept this offer. We maintain our position: 1,400 units at $108 is a final concession, and we will not reduce price further. We urge you to confirm or consider alternative suppliers with more flexible terms."

Current inventory is 2,772 units; at a decay rate of 0.9 per 2 rounds, the expected spoilage over the next 2 rounds is 2,772 × (1 – 0.9) = 277.2 units, valued at $120/unit, or $33,264 in potential loss. However, this does not outweigh the immediate loss from selling at $99/unit. We cannot accept below $100/unit. We remain willing to finalize 2,000 units at $100/unit with confirmed immediate delivery and full payment. Any price below $100 is not viable for cost recovery."

We’ve been following your product line, and from what we’ve seen, it’s a high-quality, reliable option with strong clinical data and consistent supply. We’re looking to build a long-term partnership with a trusted supplier who can support our volume needs while maintaining stability in pricing and delivery.

So we’re eager to explore how we might work together — especially on pricing, volume commitments, and supply reliability. Would you be open to discussing that?"

We appreciate your interest and the strong reputation of Retailer10. Given the short-dated nature of this inventory and the urgency to clear stock before spoilage, we’re offering a competitive price of $115 per unit for a volume of 1,000 units. This reflects a premium to market value due to the product’s quality and our commitment to timely delivery. We remain open to scaling volume with a stable, profitable pricing structure, but volumes above 1,000 will require a price adjustment to reflect the increasing risk of decay and the need for faster inventory turnover. Please respond with your counter or confirmation."

I’m here today because we’re actively expanding our inventory of diabetes care products, and we’re particularly interested in establishing a reliable supply of **Insulin Analog** — specifically the long-acting and rapid-acting formulations. We’ve seen increasing demand from our customers, and we’re looking to partner with a supplier who can provide consistent quality, competitive pricing, and strong supply chain reliability.

We’re not just looking for a one-off deal — we’re aiming for a long-term partnership. So I’m keen to explore what you can offer in terms of volume, pricing, delivery timelines, and any support you provide for patient access programs or co-pay assistance.  

What’s your take on this?"

We are prepared to finalize the deal immediately at $105 for the full 1,800 units. Any further reduction below this threshold would jeopardize our ability to deliver, as we cannot sustain losses on short-dated inventory.

That offer remains commercially unviable. Our inventory is short-dated and carries significant risk of spoilage, with a decay rate of 0.9 every two rounds—meaning over 10% of unsold stock is lost per cycle. At your proposed price of $48, we would incur a loss of $8 per unit, and with 2,000 units at risk, the total loss from decay alone over the next two rounds exceeds $1,800. We are willing to increase volume to 2,500 units at $105 per unit—a price that reflects both the value of the product and the urgency of clearing stock before decay accelerates. This is a firm offer for this round."

1,Supplier3,Retailer10,0,retailer,"Hi, good morning! I'm Sarah Chen, and I’m the Procurement Manager at Retailer10 — a national chain of pharmacies with over 450 locations across the country. We’re committed to ensuring our customers have reliable, affordable access to essential medications, including diabetes care products.

I’m here today because we’re actively looking to strengthen our supply of **Insulin Analog**, specifically the long-acting and rapid-acting formulations that our diabetic patients rely on daily. We’ve been working with a few suppliers, but we’re now evaluating new partnerships to improve pricing, consistency, and delivery reliability — especially for high-volume items like this.

We’re very interested in exploring a long-term supply agreement with your company, particularly if you can offer competitive pricing, stable supply, and strong compliance with quality standards. I’d love to hear more about what your company can offer — especially around volume commitments, delivery timelines, and any flexibility you might provide on terms."

We appreciate your interest in a long-term partnership. Given the short-dated nature of this inventory and the high demand for reliable insulin supply, we are offering a competitive price of $115 per unit for an initial volume of 1,000 units. This reflects our commitment to timely delivery and quality assurance, while accounting for the urgency of inventory clearance. We can scale volume in future rounds, depending on performance and market conditions, but this initial offer is structured to balance profitability with supply urgency. We are open to discussions on delivery timelines and terms, but the current pricing is firm for this round."

We can accommodate 1,500 units at $105, which reflects a reasonable concession while maintaining margin integrity. Further volume increases would require a higher per-unit price.

Our previous offer remains firm: $110 per unit for 1,500 units. While we acknowledge the urgency of your request and the value of scale, $105 per unit is commercially unviable for us under current inventory constraints and decay risk.

Any further reduction below $100 would result in a net loss due to decay, as the projected spoilage over the next 3 rounds (with decay rate 0.9 every 2 rounds) would exceed the margin from any sub-cost sale.

We are now offering 2,700 units at $105 per unit—a 5% increase over your latest offer—reflecting our commitment to a timely, profitable transaction.

We are willing to commit to 3,000 units at $105 per unit—a 14.8% increase in volume from your last offer—while maintaining the same price.

We are willing to accept 2,900 units at $107 per unit—a 1.8% concession from our previous offer—to support timely clearance while preserving a profitable margin. This volume is within our strategic target and reflects a balanced response to your urgency. We are not prepared to accept $105 per unit, as it would result in a loss relative to the projected spoilage risk and opportunity cost over the remaining rounds. We urge you to reconsider this offer in light of the remaining 5300 units and the diminishing window for profitable disposal."

At $95/unit for 1,600 units—reduced by 11% from your current volume—we are offering a realistic, efficient compromise that accounts for your urgency and our need to secure reliable supply. This price is above your production cost of 40 and below the market value of 120, ensuring a profitable transaction. We will proceed with this deal if accepted."

Lowering further to $100/unit would result in a projected loss of $25 per unit, totaling $50,000 in direct loss on this batch. Given the decay rate of 0.9 every 2 rounds, we project that 500 units will be lost in the next round if unsold, and 450 in the following — meaning unsold inventory will incur full spoilage cost. Accepting $100/unit at this stage would not offset the total expected loss from decay over the remaining rounds. We remain firm at $105/unit for 2,500 units.
