Our initial offer was based on the urgency of the short-dated inventory and the premium associated with quality and reliability.

We have re-evaluated the urgency of the situation and the projected decay over the remaining rounds. At a decay rate of 0.95 every two rounds, the value of unsold inventory declines by 5% per two-round cycle. With 3 rounds remaining, the total potential value loss for unsold units would be approximately 14.3% (1 - 0.95^1.5 ≈ 0.143), meaning that any unsold volume would lose significant value.  

Our current offer of $110 per unit for 1,200 units reflects a strategic compromise to prioritize high-margin, time-sensitive sales while avoiding total spoilage. We are not able to accept $105 per unit, as it would result in a net loss relative to the remaining shelf life and market value, even with volume scaling.  

However, we acknowledge your volume commitment and willingness to act quickly. We are prepared to finalize this deal at $110 per unit for 1,200 units, with delivery confirmed within 7 days.

We remain firm on our $100 per unit threshold. Your offer at $95 represents an unacceptable loss given the remaining shelf life, regulatory quality, and the risk of spoilage over the next two rounds. We have already lost 500 units to decay, and further delays increase the likelihood of total inventory write-down. While we appreciate your urgency, we cannot accept below $100. We are prepared to close 2,200 units at $100 — a fair compromise reflecting both our cost structure and the time-sensitive nature of this stock. Any further reduction would violate our minimum margin requirement and jeopardize our ability to manage the remaining pool profitably. Let’s finalize at $100."

The loss aversion exception is triggered: with 7 rounds remaining and a decay rate of 0.95 every 2 rounds, the projected spoilage of the unsold 8000 units over the remaining rounds exceeds 40% of the current stock if no deal is secured. At a price of $42, the total revenue from selling 2000 units is $84,000. The loss from spoilage if no deal is made (assuming full decay of unsold inventory) would be 8000 × $40 = $320,000 in effective loss. Thus, selling at $42, while below cost, prevents a greater loss and is a strategic necessity. We accept this offer under these urgency conditions.

We acknowledge your offer but cannot accept $45 per unit as it falls below our minimum viable threshold for this inventory, given the projected loss from spoilage in the remaining rounds. While we are under pressure to clear stock, a price of $45 results in a net loss of $5 per unit, which is only justified if the expected spoilage exceeds the value of the sale. Given the current decay rate (0.95 every 2 rounds) and 6 rounds remaining, we project that without a deal, approximately 5300 × (0.95)^3 ≈ 4400 units will be lost — a value of ~$440,000 at market value. However, selling at $45/unit for 1600 units yields only $72,000 in revenue, which is insufficient to offset the projected spoilage. Thus, we must maintain a price above $45.

We’re not just looking for a one-off deal — we’re aiming for a partnership. We want stable pricing, flexible volume options, and strong compliance with regulatory standards. We’re also open to discussion on co-promotion or joint patient support programs if there’s mutual interest.

I’d love to hear where you’re at with your Insulin Analog supply capabilities — and whether you’d be open to exploring a partnership."

While we acknowledge the pressure of decay and your cost constraints, $105 per unit is not viable—this would result in a material loss given the current decay rate (0.95 per 2 rounds) and the risk of remaining inventory spoiling in the next 4 rounds. At $110, we ensure profitability and preserve the integrity of our supply commitment. We are not willing to accept a price below $110 for this volume. However, we are open to increasing the volume at this price if you can commit to a larger order. Otherwise, we must conclude that this deal is not feasible at your current terms."

However, $105 per unit still falls below our sustainable threshold, particularly given the remaining shelf-life risk and the fact that we hold only 2,600 units in total. We are prepared to accept a compromise at $107 per unit for the full remaining inventory of 2,600 units — the maximum volume we can offer. This price reflects a 1.9% concession from our previous offer, balancing your need for urgency with our need to avoid total loss from spoilage. Any further reduction would result in a net loss on a per-unit basis, which is not commercially viable. We strongly recommend accepting this offer to secure the entire remaining stock before the next decay cycle.

Given the current market value of $120 and your production cost of $40, we believe a price of $85 per unit is a fair and efficient starting point for a volume of 800 units, which aligns with our immediate needs and allows for timely execution. We’re prepared to scale further if the pricing supports a sustainable, low-cost supply chain."

We’re committed to ensuring patients have consistent, affordable access to life-saving medications, including diabetes care products.

I’m here today because we’re actively expanding our portfolio of insulin analogs — specifically rapid-acting and long-acting formulations — to meet growing demand from our patients.

We’re looking for a long-term partnership, so we’re hoping to align on terms that benefit both our patients and your business.

Our position remains firm: $108 per unit is the minimum acceptable price for 2,200 units. This reflects the clinical value of the product, the urgency of decay, and our need to avoid total loss in the remaining rounds. We have already made significant concessions from our initial $115 offer. Accepting $100 would result in a loss of $8 per unit, totaling $9,600 in direct loss — a figure that far exceeds the projected spoilage loss from holding the remaining 9500 units across 3 more rounds (projected spoilage: 9500 × (1 - 0.95^3) ≈ 1,300 units, valued at ~$120/unit = $156,000 in potential loss). However, the $8/unit loss at $100 is not justified by the decay risk, as it would not be fully offset by avoided spoilage. We therefore cannot accept $100.

I’m here today because we’re actively looking to strengthen our supply of insulin analogs — specifically, long-acting and rapid-acting formulations — to meet growing demand from our customers managing type 1 and type 2 diabetes. We’ve seen a steady increase in prescriptions over the past year, and we’re committed to maintaining consistent availability of high-quality insulin products.

That’s why we’re interested in exploring a long-term partnership with your company. We’re not just looking for a one-off deal — we’re looking for a reliable, scalable supplier who can support our volume needs with consistent quality, competitive pricing, and strong logistics. I’d love to hear more about your current offerings and what you’re able to provide."

I’m here today to express our strong interest in establishing a long-term supply partnership with your company for **Insulin Analog** — specifically, rapid-acting and long-acting formulations. With the growing number of patients managing type 1 and type 2 diabetes, reliable access to high-quality insulin analogs is critical for us, both from a clinical and operational standpoint.

We’ve been evaluating several suppliers, and your product line has stood out for its consistent quality, strong clinical data, and robust supply chain track record. We’re looking to build a strategic, sustainable partnership — one that ensures stable pricing, predictable delivery timelines, and flexible volume commitments to meet patient demand across our network.

I’d love to hear more about your current supply capabilities, pricing models, and any volume incentives you might offer for a multi-year agreement. How does that sound?"

We remain at our $110/unit offer for 2,000 units. Your latest counter at $108/unit for 1,600 units still falls below our minimum acceptable margin threshold.

We have already made a significant concession from our initial $115 offer. Reducing the price further would result in unacceptable losses, especially with only 4 rounds remaining and ongoing spoilage at 0.95 per 2 rounds. We are not prepared to accept $105, as it falls below our viability threshold. We stand firm at $110/2,000.

1,Supplier1,Retailer10,0,retailer,"Hi, good morning! My name is Sarah Mitchell, and I’m the Procurement Manager at Retailer10 — a nationwide chain of pharmacy and healthcare retail stores with over 320 locations across the country. We specialize in providing affordable, high-quality prescription medications and essential health products to patients, with a strong focus on chronic disease management and accessibility.

I’m here today because we’re actively expanding our diabetes care portfolio, and we’re very interested in establishing a reliable supply partnership for **Insulin Analog** — specifically, rapid-acting and long-acting formulations like Humalog, NovoLog, Lantus, and Tresiba. We’re looking to strengthen our inventory consistency, particularly in high-demand regions, and we believe your product line meets the quality and scalability we need.

We’ve been impressed with your track record in supply reliability and regulatory compliance, and we’d love to explore a long-term agreement that supports both our patients and your business. I’m open to discussing pricing, volume commitments, delivery timelines, and any potential incentives or support programs you might offer.  

So, what’s your take on this? Would you be open to discussing terms that could work for both sides?"
