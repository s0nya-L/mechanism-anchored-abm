That offer is far too low for consideration. The proposed price does not reflect the premium quality, safety standards, and urgency of the short-dated inventory. We are willing to reduce price slightly to support a timely deal, but only on a revised volume of 1,500 units at $105 per unit. This represents a significant concession given the market value and decay risk.

We acknowledge the premium quality and urgency, but 105 is still above our target. Our current offer of 1,800 units at $100 per unit reflects a realistic valuation based on the decay rate (0.99 every 2 rounds), market dynamics, and our ability to move inventory efficiently. This volume is a strategic increase, demonstrating commitment, and we believe it justifies a meaningful price reduction. We are ready to close swiftly at this level—final offer."

We are at a critical juncture in managing this short-dated inventory, with decay accelerating and only 5,100 units remaining. Your offer of $105 at 1,100 units is insufficient to justify the risk and urgency we face. We are now offering 3,000 units at $105 — a meaningful concession from our previous $108 — to incentivize a substantial volume commitment. This price reflects the diminishing value of unsold stock and our need to avoid spoilage. We are not able to reduce further without incurring unacceptable losses given the decay rate.

We reaffirm our final offer of 1,800 units at $98/unit. With a decay rate of 0.99 per 2 rounds, the remaining 53 units will lose ~1 unit to spoilage in the next cycle—value loss of ~$120. Accepting $98/unit on 1,800 units yields a margin of $18,000, compared to a potential loss of $2,600 if we walk away and let the full 53 units expire. We are prepared to close now at $98/unit. Any further price reduction is not feasible. I agree to this deal.

I’m here today to express strong interest in establishing a long-term supply agreement for **Insulin Analog**, particularly the rapid-acting and long-acting formulations — things like insulin lispro, aspart, and glargine.

Given our volume and customer demand, we’re keen to build a partnership that’s not just transactional, but truly collaborative.

1,Supplier3,Retailer6,0,retailer,"Hi there, good to meet you. My name is Sarah Chen, and I’m the Procurement Manager at Retailer6 — we’re a nationwide network of 240+ pharmacy retail outlets across the country, with a strong focus on accessible, high-quality healthcare products for patients with chronic conditions like diabetes.

I’m here today specifically to discuss the possibility of establishing a long-term supply partnership for **Insulin Analog**, particularly the rapid-acting and long-acting formulations. We’ve seen a growing demand among our customers for these newer insulin variants — they offer better glycemic control and more flexibility in dosing, which our patients really appreciate.

We’re currently evaluating suppliers and would love to learn more about your product line, pricing structure, supply reliability, and any support you offer for pharmacy-based distribution — especially around cold chain logistics and patient education materials.

So, I’m really interested in exploring how we can work together to make this critical medication more consistently available to the communities we serve."

We have reviewed your latest offer. While we acknowledge the urgency of your demand, $99 per unit remains below our threshold for profitability, especially given the current decay risk and remaining inventory lifecycle. Our revised offer of $108 per unit for 2,800 units is a strategic compromise that reflects both the short-dated nature of the inventory and our need to maintain a viable margin. This price is consistent with our prior deal at $108 and aligns with our lowest accepted price to date, ensuring we remain profitable while clearing critical volume. We are prepared to close swiftly, but any further reduction below $108 would not be commercially feasible."

Our position remains firm at $110 per unit for 1,800 units.

1,Supplier3,Retailer7,0,retailer,"Hi, good morning! I’m Sarah Chen, and I’m the procurement manager at Retailer7 — a national retail pharmacy chain with over 1,200 stores across the country. We’re known for providing accessible, high-quality healthcare products to communities, and insulin is one of the most critical medications we stock.

I’m here today because we’re actively looking to strengthen our supply of Insulin Analog — specifically the long-acting variant, such as insulin glargine, and possibly rapid-acting analogs like insulin lispro. With rising demand and tighter supply chain pressures, we’re prioritizing stable, reliable partnerships with suppliers who can offer consistent quality, competitive pricing, and strong delivery reliability.

We’re very interested in discussing a potential long-term supply agreement with your company. I’d love to hear more about your production capacity, pricing structure, and what kind of support you offer in terms of documentation, compliance, and logistics. How does that sound?"

We’re looking for reliable supply, competitive pricing, and strong support — especially around inventory management and patient support programs.

We’re open to discussing volume commitments and potential exclusivity in certain regions, depending on the terms. Would you be able to share more about your current availability, pricing structure, and any support services you offer for retailers like us?"

We are now reiterating our previous offer: $100 per unit for 3,000 units. This represents a balanced compromise—maintaining a strong profit margin while significantly advancing our inventory clearance goal. With 8400.0 units remaining and decay continuing at 0.99 every two rounds, delaying this deal increases the risk of spoilage and total loss.

- Thank you for your offer. While we appreciate your commitment to reliability, we are currently evaluating multiple suppliers and must prioritize cost efficiency to maintain patient affordability.

This is our best offer for a volume-driven agreement."
1,Supplier2,Retailer10,0,retailer,"Hi there, thanks for having me. My name is Sarah Chen, and I’m the Procurement Manager at Retailer10 — we’re a nationwide chain of retail pharmacies with over 1,200 locations across the country. We’re committed to making essential medications, especially for chronic conditions like diabetes, more accessible and affordable for our customers.

I’m here today because we’re actively expanding our inventory of insulin analogs — particularly long-acting and rapid-acting formulations — to better serve our patient base. We’ve seen increasing demand, especially for branded and biosimilar options that offer consistent efficacy and reliability.

We’re currently evaluating suppliers and would love to explore a partnership with your company. I’m particularly interested in your current pricing, volume commitments, supply stability, and any future availability of biosimilar options. We’re looking for a reliable, scalable partner who can support our growth while maintaining high quality and compliance standards.

So, I’d love to hear what you’ve got to offer — especially around volume pricing and long-term supply commitments."

This volume is aligned with your scale and ensures efficient fulfillment without overcommitting our limited stock. We can support future biosimilar availability and long-term supply, but current terms are focused on clearing near-term inventory. Let’s discuss how this volume and pricing align with your needs."

We appreciate your volume commitment and partnership intent, but $105 per unit falls significantly below our commercial threshold for this inventory profile. The short-dated nature of the product requires a pricing structure that reflects both market value and the urgency of de-risking spoilage.

This reflects the premium associated with immediate delivery, quality assurance, and the escalating risk of spoilage with each passing round. Reducing the volume to 1,200 at $105 would not sufficiently offset the decay risk we face, and we require a higher margin to justify the exposure. Our offer of 2,000 units at $108 balances urgency with profitability and represents our final competitive proposal for this round.
