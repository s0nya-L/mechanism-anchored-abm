We reiterate our previous offer: 1,500 units at $110 per unit — a price that reflects the urgency of decay, maintains a healthy margin above cost, and remains within the competitive range of the market. We are not prepared to accept any offer below $110 per unit, as doing so would trigger a loss aversion exception that is only justifiable if the projected spoilage loss exceeds the immediate loss. The current decay rate of 0.99 every two rounds means 3700 units will lose 1% of value every two rounds, but we are still in a position to secure profitable sales. We remain open to volume increases at this price, but no further concessions below $110 are possible."

The total value of this deal is $152,600, which reflects a net profit of $63,700 (excluding decay) and aligns with our urgency to clear stock efficiently.

Your offer of $65/unit for 1,400 units is not aligned with our current pricing strategy for short-dated inventory, despite the attractive margin. Our offer at $48/unit for 1,200 units reflects a 20% markup above cost, which remains within our established threshold and is consistent with prior accepted deals (lowest accepted price: $45). Given the decay rate of 0.99 every 2 rounds and our remaining stock of 3,123.0 units, we must prioritize deals that ensure volume clearance without sacrificing profitability. We are willing to increase volume to 1,400 units only if the price is reduced to $48/unit. Any further price increase beyond this would require a significantly larger volume or a material concession in our decay risk mitigation strategy.

2,Supplier2,Retailer10,0,retailer,"Hi, good morning! I’m Sarah Chen — I’m the Procurement Manager at Retailer10, a nationwide chain of pharmacy and healthcare retail outlets with over 280 stores across the country. We specialize in providing affordable, high-quality prescription medications and diabetes care products to patients in both urban and rural communities.

I’m here today because we’re actively expanding our diabetes management portfolio, and we’ve been closely evaluating insulin analogs as a key part of that strategy. We’re particularly interested in securing a reliable, long-term supply of high-quality insulin analogs — especially rapid-acting and long-acting formulations — to meet growing patient demand and support our commitment to improving access to essential diabetes therapies.

We’ve done our research, and your company has a strong reputation for manufacturing reliable, compliant insulin products. That’s why we’re eager to explore a partnership. I’d love to hear more about your current portfolio, supply capabilities, pricing structure, and any volume-based incentives you might offer."

Given the short-dated nature of this inventory and the urgency to clear stock before decay impacts value, we are offering 1,000 units at $55 per unit. This reflects a reasonable margin above cost while acknowledging the time-sensitive nature of the product. We are open to incremental volume increases in subsequent rounds, provided pricing remains viable and the total volume across all retailers remains within our capacity to deliver efficiently."

Our offer of $52/unit for 1,000 units balances the market ceiling of $120, the supplier’s cost floor of $40, and the decay pressure (0.99 per round), yielding a total value of $52,000 — a rational midpoint that reflects shared urgency and efficient clearance.

We appreciate the rationality of your offer and acknowledge the urgency of decay. However, we cannot accept $52/unit for 1,000 units as it exceeds our current pricing tolerance. To maintain alignment with our cost structure and decay trajectory, we revise our offer to $50/unit for 1,500 units. This reflects a balanced compromise: we increase volume by 50% to accelerate clearance, while maintaining a margin above cost and mitigating spoilage risk. Given the decay rate of 0.99 every two rounds, delaying this deal further would reduce recoverable value by ~1% per round. We are prepared to offer additional volume at this price in the next round if this deal proceeds."

We acknowledge the decay risk and cost constraints, but $45 offers insufficient incentive for efficient clearance given the 1,000-unit cap. By increasing volume to 1,600 units, we amplify your turnover rate and reduce per-unit decay exposure. At $50 per unit, we are targeting the symmetric midpoint (80) while ensuring you retain a 25% margin above cost (40), which is sustainable and aligned with shared urgency. This offer reflects rational risk-sharing and maximizes your effective revenue under short-dated conditions. We are ready to close if this is acceptable."

We are willing to increase volume to 1,200 units at $58 per unit, which yields $69,600—still above cost, more efficient in clearing inventory, and reduces long-term decay exposure. We remain flexible but require a price above $55 to sustain margin sustainability."

Your offer of $52 per unit for 1,600 units remains below our minimum viable threshold of $54, which is required to ensure profitability and prevent inventory loss under decay pressure. We have already committed to 1,200 units at $54 in prior messages, and this remains our firm position. While we acknowledge your volume ambition, increasing volume beyond 1,200 at $52 would result in a loss of $8 per unit (52 – 40 = 12; 54 – 40 = 14; net margin loss of $2 per unit on the incremental 400 units), which is not sustainable given the decay risk and our profit target. We are willing to reconsider volume increases only if the price is at or above $54. We recommend adjusting to $54 for 1,200 units to secure a profitable, timely transaction."

We recognize the urgency and the rationality of your position, but we must uphold a minimum margin that ensures profitability given the decay risk. Accepting $53/unit for 1,200 units would result in a loss of $10.5K in potential profit compared to a $54/unit price on 1,500 units—this gap is not sustainable in the context of a 0.99 decay rate over 6 remaining rounds. Our revised offer of $54/unit for 1,500 units maintains a healthy margin above cost while significantly accelerating inventory clearance.

With a decay rate of 0.99 every 2 rounds and 7 rounds remaining, failing to secure a price above 40 risks total inventory loss due to spoilage. Our offer of $110 for 1,500 units is a strategic concession reflecting urgency, but it remains within a profitable and rational range. We will not accept any price below $40 under any circumstance. Please submit a revised offer above $40 or reconsider the viability of this negotiation."

This reflects the true urgency of short-dated inventory, decay risk, and the need for a sustainable margin given the remaining rounds. $100/unit offers only 60% of the potential margin (from $40 to $120), which undercompensates for the risk of spoilage and the time-sensitive nature of the transaction.

We propose $95 as a realistic starting point that accounts for decay urgency and ensures a viable margin for both parties. Let’s move toward an efficient agreement."

We’re committed to ensuring patients have reliable, affordable access to essential medicines, especially chronic care treatments like insulin.

I’m here today because we’re actively looking to strengthen our supply chain for **Insulin Analog**, particularly the long-acting and rapid-acting formulations. With rising demand and increasing patient needs, we’re evaluating new suppliers to ensure we can maintain consistent availability, competitive pricing, and stable delivery timelines.

We’ve heard positive things about your product line and are very interested in exploring a potential partnership.

We recognize the urgency of the decay timeline and the shared incentive to avoid spoilage, but a price of $65 per unit represents a significant deviation from our cost recovery and profitability threshold.

We retain the strategic option to reconsider only if the total projected spoilage loss exceeds the immediate margin loss. For now, we stand by $110 at 1,400 units as the minimum viable and rational economic threshold."

The decay rate of 0.99 per 2 rounds implies a 1% value loss every 2 rounds, and with only 8 rounds remaining, we face a projected spoilage risk of ~7.7% if no deal is struck. At this stage, our pricing must reflect both the diminished shelf life and the risk of total loss. We are willing to increase volume to 2,000 units at $55 to signal strong intent to clear stock efficiently, while maintaining a sustainable margin. This offer accounts for the risk premium and decay, and is our best balance between urgency and profitability. We remain open to further adjustment if you can match or exceed this volume at a price above $50."

Our current offer of $109 per unit for 1,200 units represents a final, strategic concession balancing decay risk with profitability. This price accounts for the near-term expiry and maintains a meaningful margin above cost. We are not able to accept $108, as it falls below our threshold for sustainable profitability under the current decay trajectory and remaining inventory constraints. This is our best and final offer."

Your offer of $58 for 700 units at this stage does not adequately reflect the accelerating decay risk over the remaining 8 rounds. With a decay rate of 0.99 per 2 rounds, unsold inventory faces a projected value loss of ~7.7% by the end of the cycle, and we are already at 6210.0 units remaining. At $58, the margin is insufficient to justify the risk of total spoilage, especially given that we must clear the bulk of our stock efficiently.

This volume is aligned with our capacity to deliver efficiently in this round. We are prepared to consider higher volume in future rounds if pricing remains above $100."

This price is based on the anticipated decay over the next 8 rounds (0.99 per 2 rounds), which will reduce remaining value by ~8.3% by the end of the cycle.

At $115, the supplier captures 71% of the available profit margin, leaving us with minimal incentive to proceed. Given the decay rate of 0.99 per round and the shared urgency, a rational midpoint between cost ($40) and market value ($120) is $80. We reiterate our previous offer at $50 per unit for 1,000 units — a price that reflects balanced risk, shared urgency, and sustainable partnership. We expect a revised offer that reflects this equilibrium."

The current offer remains below any rational threshold for profitability given the decay pressure and market dynamics.

MESSAGE:  
Your offer of $103 per unit remains fundamentally misaligned with the reality of short-dated inventory and the urgent need to liquidate stock before decay causes total loss. The market value of $120 is not a pricing floor—it is a reference point for value, not a justification for extreme margins. At $103, you are capturing a 63% margin (103–40 = 63), which is unsustainable given that the remaining stock will decay at 0.99 every 2 rounds. With 5 rounds left, the expected remaining inventory after decay is 9900 × (0.99)^(5/2) ≈ 9900 × 0.975 ≈ 9652.5 units—meaning over 200 units will be lost regardless of deal progress. We cannot accept a price that assumes the full market value while ignoring our risk. Our offer of $45 per unit maintains a 12.5% margin, which is viable under the decay constraint and reflects fair urgency-based pricing. We remain willing to adjust volume to 1,500 or 2,000 as needed, but we cannot accept a price that ignores decay risk and prioritizes margin capture over survival of the transaction.

We appreciate your alignment on volume and urgency. A price of $51 per unit for 1,500 units reflects a 27.5% margin over cost, which is consistent with the accelerating decay risk and our need to clear inventory efficiently.

We maintain our position at $48 per unit for 1,500 units. This pricing reflects our cost base and the critical decay risk, with a 0.99 decay factor accelerating spoilage every two rounds. Accepting below $48 would result in a loss of $1.60 per unit relative to our cost, which is only justifiable if the immediate risk of spoilage outweighs the margin.

We propose 2,500 units at $46 per unit — a concession of $2 from your price, but with a 35% volume increase to accelerate clearance.

We recognize the mutual urgency driven by the decay rate (0.99 every 2 rounds) and the shared interest in efficient clearance. However, a price of $52 per unit falls below our current threshold for maintaining a sustainable margin, especially given that 1,000 units represent a significant portion of our remaining stock (4,550.0). Our offer of $53 per unit for 1,000 units reflects a strategic compromise that balances profitability with the need to secure volume before decay impacts future viability.

However, $52 per unit for 900 units yields a margin of 12.5% over cost (52–40 = 12; 12/40 = 30%), which is below our required threshold for this short-dated inventory. To maintain profitability and incentivize timely execution, we are increasing the price to $53 per unit for 900 units. This reflects a 32.5% margin over cost and is justified by the decay rate and the need to secure a profitable exit before further spoilage.

That offer is far too low for consideration. Please make a realistic offer. The proposed price of $48 per unit is below our cost recovery threshold and unsustainable given the decay risk.

However, we are not prepared to accept such a loss unless the projected decay loss surpasses the total margin. Our current offer of $110 per unit for 2500 units maintains a 175% markup over cost and is 91.7% of market value — a fair balance between urgency and profitability.

Your offer of $47 at 2,500 units falls below our critical threshold for margin sustainability, especially given the remaining stock decay risk. While we acknowledge the urgency, accepting $47 would result in a loss of $1 per unit compared to our cost, which is only justified if the projected spoilage loss exceeds the immediate loss. With 8 rounds remaining and a decay rate of 0.99 every 2 rounds, the expected spoilage of 2,500 units over time would be approximately 1,050 units (calculated as 2,500 × (1 - 0.99^4) ≈ 1,050), resulting in a loss of $42,000 in potential value (1,050 × $40). However, the immediate loss from selling at $47 is $1 per unit, or $2,500 total—significantly lower than the projected spoilage loss. Therefore, we accept the volume increase to 2,500 units, but only at $48 per unit. This price fully offsets the decay risk, ensures a $8 profit per unit, and aligns with our strategic goal of minimizing total loss.

We’re currently evaluating our current supplier lineup and are very interested in expanding our portfolio with a reliable, high-volume provider of insulin analogs.  

We’re particularly interested in pricing, long-term supply stability, and flexible order volumes — especially with the ability to scale during peak seasons. We’d love to hear what your company offers, and whether you’re open to a partnership that could support our growing patient base. How does that sound?"

This aligns with the urgency of the situation—each round reduces value by 1%, and we are committed to maximizing profitable sales before further decay. We are willing to adjust volume or price further if you can justify a higher volume at a slightly higher price."

We have carefully evaluated your counter. While we appreciate your rationale, we cannot accept $50 per unit for 2,500 units, as it falls below our current threshold for profitability given the accelerating decay risk. Our revised offer of $52 per unit for 2,000 units reflects a balanced compromise: it maintains a healthy margin above cost, aligns with the market value trajectory, and preserves inventory for future high-potential deals. We are willing to consider increasing volume to 2,500 units only if the price is raised to $54 per unit, which better accounts for the 0.99 decay rate and the projected loss of value over the remaining rounds. This is our final offer on this volume."

We acknowledge your final offer of $50 for 1,000 units, which aligns with the current market midpoint and decay-adjusted value. However, to maximize efficiency and prevent further spoilage—given that each round reduces inventory value by 1% and we have only 6 rounds remaining—we are increasing our offer to 1,200 units at $50 per unit. This maintains your agreed price, increases volume by 20%, and reduces the risk of unsold stock depreciating to near-zero value. The total profit remains robust, and the incremental volume is fully justified by the urgency of decay. We remain open to further adjustments only if a larger volume commitment is secured at this price."

Based on the market value of $120 and your production cost of $40, the midpoint is $80 — but given decay urgency and your offer at $45, we propose $55 as a fair midpoint between your floor and our target. We’re reducing volume to 800 to align with your likely available stock and to signal efficiency. This offer reflects a rational, symmetric assessment of risk and value.

To align with the shared goal of minimizing spoilage while ensuring profitability, we revise our offer to $110 per unit for 1,500 units. This reflects a balanced trade-off: a 4.3% premium over your price, while increasing volume by 25% to reduce per-unit decay exposure. We maintain our commitment to timely execution and are prepared to adjust further if justified by your demonstrated readiness."

We are willing to finalize 800 units at $45/unit, but only if this is a firm commitment. Any further reduction would exceed our loss aversion threshold and risk total inventory loss due to decay.

We now offer $52/unit for the full remaining inventory of 1,994 units—maximizing recovery while respecting the 0.99 decay factor and ensuring no inventory loss. This price is 30% above cost and 56.7% of market value, balancing urgency and profitability. Accepting this deal secures full volume clearance in one transaction. We will not reduce price further unless decay risk justifies it. Final offer."

MESSAGE:  
We reaffirm our original agreement at $48/unit for 2,000 units, which was mutually accepted and aligned with decay-adjusted value ($40 cost, $120 market, midpoint $80). The supplier’s counter to $52/unit (a 10.8% markup from our accepted price) exceeds the rational midpoint and undermines the urgency-based fairness of the initial deal. Given the shared decay risk (0.99 per 2 rounds) and our prior commitment, we maintain $48/unit as the efficient, symmetric price. We will proceed with this offer unless the supplier demonstrates a material change in stock or decay exposure.  

I agree to this deal.

MESSAGE:  
We appreciate your outreach and the strategic alignment on insulin availability. Given the short-dated nature of our current inventory and the urgency to liquidate before decay impacts value, we are offering 2,000 units at $45 per unit. This price reflects a premium over production cost to ensure profitability while remaining competitive in the current market. We can scale volume up to 10,000 units across negotiations, but this initial offer balances urgency, margin, and inventory constraints. Delivery is available within 48 hours. We can also support your clinical education initiatives with product training materials. Let us know if this aligns with your procurement needs."

MESSAGE:  
We appreciate your offer and the urgency around short-dated inventory. Based on symmetric decay dynamics (0.99 decay per 2 rounds) and market value of 120, a price of 55 reflects a rational midpoint between your floor (40) and market ceiling, ensuring mutual efficiency. We’re willing to increase volume to 3,000 units to support your need for rapid liquidation, provided the price remains at or below 55. This volume supports our national rollout plans and aligns with the urgency of your inventory clock. Please confirm if this is feasible."
2,Supplier3,Retailer10,0,retailer,"Hi, good morning! I'm Sarah Chen, the Procurement Manager at Retailer10 — we’re one of the largest pharmacy retail chains in the region, with over 300 stores across urban and suburban markets. We’re committed to ensuring patients have consistent, affordable access to critical medications, especially for chronic conditions like diabetes.

I’m here today because we’re actively expanding our supply of insulin analogs — particularly rapid-acting and long-acting formulations — to meet growing demand from our customers. We’re looking to strengthen our partnership with reliable, high-quality suppliers who can offer competitive pricing, stable supply chains, and flexible terms.

We’re particularly interested in your insulin analog portfolio — especially your branded and biosimilar options — and would love to explore how we can work together to ensure continued access for patients while supporting your distribution goals. I’m open to discussing volume commitments, delivery timelines, and any support you can provide for patient access programs. Let’s talk through what’s possible."

Given the decay rate of 0.99 per round, delaying this deal reduces the effective value of your inventory. We propose $105 per unit — a 9.1% discount from your current offer, which brings the price closer to the symmetric midpoint of 80 while still allowing you a 62.5% margin above cost. This balances urgency, volume, and fairness. We expect a response that reflects mutual efficiency."

We acknowledge the urgency of decay and the value of timely execution. Your offer of $105 at 1,800 units implies a 10% volume reduction at a 9.1% price discount, but we are constrained by a maximum volume of 10,000 and the need to minimize spoilage risk. We accept your volume target of 1,800 as a signal of interest, but propose increasing price to $108 (a 2.9% increase from your offer) and raising volume to 1,900 units. This reflects a 150% margin above cost and aligns with our decay-adjusted profit maximization under symmetric market conditions. The incremental volume (100 units) at a slightly higher price improves our expected value per round, given the 0.99 decay factor. We are willing to finalize this at 1,900 units if you accept $108/unit."

- Our initial offer was based on a strong market-aligned price reflecting the product’s value and the urgency of decay. Your counter at $55 is significantly below our cost threshold and fails to account for the financial risk we bear in holding short-dated inventory. We are now revising our offer to $110 per unit for 1,500 units — a reasonable concession to reflect urgency while preserving profitability. This volume is scalable if pricing improves further. We remain committed to a timely, efficient transaction, but any further reduction below $110 would be unacceptable without a corresponding increase in volume that justifies the margin loss."

Given the decay rate of 0.99 per round, value erodes by ~12% over two rounds, creating shared urgency. At $95, we offer a 5% improvement over your last price, aligning with the symmetric midpoint and incentivizing swift closure.

Your offer reflects a reasonable understanding of the decay-driven urgency, but $95 per unit still undercompensates for the full cost of spoilage risk and the near-term expiration of this inventory. At a decay rate of 0.99 every two rounds, and with 8 rounds remaining, the value of unsold stock will erode to approximately 92.3% of its current worth — a loss of 7.7% over the full period. To reflect this, we are raising our price to $105 per unit, which captures 87.5% of the market value (120), leaving a reasonable margin for both parties while ensuring we do not absorb losses from decay. We maintain our volume at 1,000 to preserve strategic flexibility and signal serious intent. This is our best offer to secure a timely, profitable transaction."

MESSAGE:  
We acknowledge your offer’s alignment with the decay-driven urgency and your commitment to a fair, efficient transaction. Our counter of $47 per unit for 2,000 units reflects a strategic balance: it maintains a healthy margin above cost (40), leverages the urgency of short-dated inventory, and remains within the range of profitable, sustainable pricing. The volume of 2,000 units is a calculated commitment—high enough to significantly reduce remaining stock while preserving flexibility for other negotiations and ensuring we do not over-concentrate risk. Given the decay rate of 0.99 every 2 rounds, delaying this deal would result in a 1% spoilage loss per cycle, making timely execution critical. We stand ready to finalize this deal promptly if your terms can be adjusted to this offer."

Our current offer of $48 per unit for 1,400 units reflects the need to capture value now while maintaining profitability. This price exceeds cost by 20% and aligns with the upper end of our acceptable range given the urgency. We are willing to increase volume slightly to 1,400 to incentivize swift closure, but any further volume increase would require a price at or above $49.

- Price per unit: 46  
- Volume: 1500  

MESSAGE:  
We acknowledge the urgency of decay and the supplier’s position, but a price of $46 per unit remains the rational midpoint between cost ($40) and market value ($120), reflecting symmetric information and fair value. Reducing volume to 1,500 units aligns with our capacity and ensures efficient, realistic closure. This offer balances fairness, urgency, and mutual efficiency—accepting it secures your stock clearance and our patient access needs. We remain open to further alignment if you adjust your volume or price accordingly."
2,Supplier2,Retailer4,3,supplier,"OFFER:  
- Price per unit: 47  
- Volume: 1400  
MESSAGE:  
We note your continued offer at $46, but this falls below our cost-plus threshold and is inconsistent with the decay-driven urgency. At 0.99 decay per 2 rounds, unsold inventory will lose 2% of value every 2 rounds—over the remaining 4 rounds, this equates to a 4% cumulative loss. To preserve value and avoid total spoilage, we require a minimum price of $47 per unit. We are willing to commit to 1,400 units at this price, reflecting our strategic need to clear stock efficiently while maintaining profitability. This offer balances your concerns for volume and urgency with our need to avoid loss. Accepting now ensures 98% of current value is secured. We remain open to further flexibility in future rounds if this deal is closed."

- Price per unit: 47  
- Volume: 1120  
MESSAGE:  
We acknowledge the supplier’s cost floor and decay urgency. At 0.99 decay per 2 rounds, the effective shelf life is ~4.5 rounds, and the fair midpoint between cost ($40) and market value ($120) is $80. Our offer of $47/unit for 1,120 units—20% below the midpoint, 17.5% above cost—reflects a balanced, risk-adjusted price. Volume is reduced by 20% from your 1,400-unit offer to align with realistic stock availability and procurement efficiency. This deal secures 98% of current value with minimal decay risk. We propose finalizing now to lock in value before further erosion."

MESSAGE:  
- We acknowledge the rationality of your offer and the shared urgency. Accepting $52 per unit for 1,500 units strikes a balanced compromise: it improves upon your last offer by 1% while maintaining a strong margin above cost. This volume is within our risk-adjusted capacity and aligns with our need to de-risk inventory efficiently. We confirm this is our final offer for this round.

- Price per unit: 54  
- Volume: 1400  
MESSAGE:  
- We acknowledge your final offer but remain committed to fair risk-sharing. At $52 per unit for 1,500 units, the supplier captures 54% of the available profit margin, leaving us with 46%. We propose $54 per unit for 1,400 units—this adjusts the margin distribution to 52% for us and 48% for you, reflecting a more balanced trade-off given decay urgency and volume commitment. This volume is within your stated capacity and aligns with our near-term inventory needs. We are prepared to close at this level if you agree."

- Volume: 1910  
MESSAGE:  
We acknowledge your counteroffer and the intent to balance risk-sharing. However, at $54 for 1,400 units, the effective price does not sufficiently offset the accelerating decay risk given our remaining 1,910.0 units and the decay rate of 0.99 every 2 rounds. To ensure complete inventory clearance before further spoilage and to secure a profitable, final deal, we now offer the full remaining volume of 1,910 units at $52 per unit. This price maintains a clear profit margin above cost while maximizing efficiency and minimizing the risk of total loss. We are prepared to close immediately at this level. I agree to this deal.

- Volume: 1800  
MESSAGE:  
We acknowledge your final offer and the urgency to clear remaining stock. However, given the symmetric decay risk (0.99 every 2 rounds) and the market value of $120, we believe $50 per unit for 1,800 units offers a more balanced, efficient resolution. This reduces your outstanding inventory by 20% while securing a favorable price that reflects the midpoint between cost ($40) and market value ($120), minus decay-impacted variance. We are prepared to finalize at this level to ensure timely closure."
2,Supplier1,Retailer9,3,supplier,"OFFER:  
- Price per unit: 110  
- Volume: 1200  
MESSAGE:  
We cannot accept a price below $110 per unit, as it falls significantly below our cost threshold and would result in unacceptable losses given the short-dated nature of the inventory. Our offer of 1,200 units at $110 remains our best and final position. We are prepared to adjust volume or timing if needed, but any price below $110 is non-negotiable. We remain committed to a successful partnership and welcome further discussion on viable alternatives.

2,Supplier1,Retailer9,3,retailer,"OFFER:  
- Price per unit: 105  
- Volume: 1200  
MESSAGE:  
We acknowledge your position but must emphasize that $110/unit for 1,200 units offers the supplier a profit margin far exceeding the symmetric decay-adjusted midpoint. At a 0.99 decay rate, the expected value drops significantly over time, and our $105 offer reflects the fair market equilibrium between cost (40) and market cap (120), adjusted for shared urgency. We are willing to lock in 1,200 units at $105/unit to ensure efficient closure and scalability. This is our final offer."

- Price per unit: 82  
- Volume: 808  
MESSAGE:  
We acknowledge the urgency of decay and the shared incentive to clear inventory efficiently. However, your offer of $80 per unit falls significantly below our minimum viable threshold, representing a 50% margin capture (40/80) that does not account for the escalating risk of spoilage over the remaining rounds. We propose a revised offer of 808 units at $82 — a price that ensures profitability while fully clearing our remaining stock within the current round. This volume is strictly aligned with our remaining inventory (808.0), ensuring feasibility and eliminating future spoilage risk. We are prepared to finalize this deal immediately if you confirm acceptance."

MESSAGE:  
We accept your offer of $82 per unit for 808 units, but propose a final adjustment to $80 per unit to reflect the symmetric decay risk and ensure efficient execution. This price remains well above your production cost of 40 and captures a fair share of the available profit. Given your confirmed stock of 808, we agree to this volume and propose immediate closure to avoid further decay. I agree to this deal.
